    "Parameters to take into consideration for answering this question:\n",
    "- Struggling students consistently have low accuracy (below 80%) or take multiple sessions to master skills. This could be a consequence of anti-patterns, insufficient support, subpar skill plans, or knowledge gaps.\n",
    "The structure of the answer (Make sure to fill all sections of the structure of the answer):\n",

    "Q8 - Write Python code snippets to create distinct charts for Q4, Q5, Q6, and Q7. Each snippet should be tailored to illustrate the findings related to its respective question clearly and convincingly. Utilize the data provided in the 'Exact evidence and reasoning' sections for each question as the basis for your charts. Input the data values directly into the scripts without using dataframes, and ensure these values are exact, not hypothetical. The objective is to make the outcomes from each question's findings visually unmistakable through these charts. Additionally, to prevent the common 'ValueError: shape mismatch' issue, particularly when shapes between arrays don't align (e.g., one array has shape (15,) and another has shape (14,)), carefully verify that the data arrays or lists you use for plotting have matching dimensions. This check is crucial for ensuring that your scripts execute smoothly and the visual representations are clear and effective.\n",
